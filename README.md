# HTML/CSS Animation & Responsive Practice

🎯 **Purpose**:  
This project was created to **learn and practice animation and responsive design** using **only HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript. It's part of the learning journey in the **DEPI scholarship**.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure a webpage using semantic HTML.
- Responsive layout techniques using:
  - **Media Queries**
  - **Flexbox**
- Adding animations using:
  - `@keyframes`
  - CSS transitions
- Improving visual hierarchy and accessibility.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## 📱 Responsiveness

The site is fully responsive across:
- Desktop 🖥️
- Tablet 📱
- Mobile 📱

Each section adapts smoothly with a mobile-first approach and uses media queries to stack content vertically on smaller screens.

## 🧪 Status

✅ Project complete.  
🎓 Still exploring more complex animations and UI techniques.
